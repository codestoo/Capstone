# Overview
As an artist and photographer I wanted a web-site that would format to display my images that were varying sizes. Having used React for a prior project and finding it much easier to scale a large project like this I wanted to use it for this as well. With React you can use seperate components for each element needed such as a nav-bar and put it in its own component. 

# The Challenge
The challenge was to find a way to do that formatting for the photography and painting pages using things like bootstrap and vanilla css which were problematic. I did however use bootstrap cards for the home page and travel stories page as it takes care of the responsiveness.

# Solutions
In researching ways to overcome those issues and after trial and error I found an npm package, `react-photo-album` created by a fellow developer hosted on git-hub. He and his team formatted so that the images would adjust their size to fit properly.

# Technologies 
React, Supabase, Bootstrap, react-photo-album

# Style 
I wanted a dreamy look to the web-site as a whole and so I made the background color to have warm undertones rather than straight black. This lended itself nicely to that look with the [snow](https://codepen.io/alphardex/pen/dyPorwJ). While viewing the photography page the  visitor can enjoy the music by Joshua Martin.
