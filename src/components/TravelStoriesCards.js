              “Would you like dis at da bar or tavolo?” “At the bar, per
              favore.” I felt like a real local on her way to work as I stood at
              the bar and sipped my cappuccino — the surroundings’ old world
              elegance and the locals’ chic! But gee that cappuccino was small!
              I casually ordered another; this brought interesting looks from
              the barista. I think I just did something not so Italian. When I
              asked for the bathroom, I was sent downstairs only to find a huge
              room with a drain in the middle of the floor. Uhhh… where is the
              shower head? Suddenly a hip young woman casually exited another stall.
              
              <br />
              <br />

              
              <h4>Arrival</h4>
              I had waited 14 years to return to Italy. We arrived at the Star
              Hotel Majestic in Torino after 36 hours without food or sleep. I
              was struck by the grandeur of the lobby as we passed through the
              massive wood revolving door. The concierge offered suggestions for
              restaurants — we opted to go straight to bed.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since entering the city (and every village thereafter), we were
              careful not to enter the restricted area in the center of the
              historic districts. The mere thought brought back memories from a
              previous drive through London and the hefty fine which followed.
              Since dinner reservations were customary, we settled on an
              indistinct pub with chicken, fries and loud music videos. We
              couldn’t find Scottish food in Edinburgh; now we couldn’t find
              Italian food in Torino.
              <br />
              <br />

              <h4>On My Own in Torino</h4>
              After breakfast, which consisted of a croissant and cappuccino, I
              walked past beautiful shops, more coffee bars, and the Egyptian
              Museum. I was just relaxing and enjoying the scenery — only to
              find myself in the middle of a student demonstration! There in
              front of me was the University of Torino. Accompanied by police,
              the students held signs which read arabic. There had been a
              terrorist attack in Paris, and we had been there only yesterday!

            <h3>I Love Scotland and I haven't even left the Airport Yet!</h3>
            “Sittin’ in or carryin’ out?” What? How cute is that. We’re sittin’
            in. I picked up my order, Cheers…(warm smile)…I love Scotland, and I
            haven’t left the airport yet. Upon our arrival to the tiny, quaint,
            and very friendly airport, we were welcomed with open arms to the
            country…by security no less. They asked about our plans, and seemed
            genuinely interested and delighted with everything we said.

    <h4>First Impressions</h4>
   
             


    On our first impression, Edinburgh was the color gray. The buildings were gray. The sky was gray—which cast an ambience of mystery and romance over the city.
    <br />
              <br />


    <h4> Our Bed and Breakfast</h4>

   


    After 36 hours of traveling, we arrived at our B&B guest house: an 1870’s three-story Victorian structure. Our cottage sat at the back of the house with a separate entrance, kitchen, sitting room, and a bedroom with two soft, enticing beds…
    <br />
              <br />


We awoke famished.

<br />
              <br />

And so our hunt (with sword-and-dagger) for Scottish food began. After wandering around Prince street for half an hour, we finally accepted defeat and had Bar-B-Q and fries.
<br />
              <br />



Back at our cottage, I reflected in a cozy green armchair that overlooked a quiet courtyard. I gazed out the window as the sunny day lapsed into a chilly, misty scene. Sigh. In Scotland, there truly are four seasons in a day…
<br />
              <br />


<h4>Tradtitional Scottish Breakfast</h4>



In the morning we headed down our little path to breakfast in the main house. We were asked for our choices of everything.
<br />
              <br />


Like the English breakfast, the Scottish breakfast was very hardy: eggs cooked to order, sausage and ham, marmalades, toast, scones, and porridge (oatmeal) with hot coffee and tea. I had my own pot of coffee; how do they keep it so hot? And—oh!—that marmalade in those small white bowls with tiny spoons is so classy. Where are the scones? How can I get my hands on one? They keep offering me toast…
